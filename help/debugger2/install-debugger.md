Click the icon to start Debugger. 

After Debugger opens, you can select your preferred appearance by going to **<!UICONTROL Settings>** and selecting either **Dark Mode** (default) or **Light Mode**.

As you change pages on your site, the Debugger window updates to show info for that page. The name of the page you're connected to shows at the bottom of the screen. To keep Debugger locked on one page, click **[!UICONTROL Lock]** in the bottom right corner of the Debugger window.
